enum technologyEnum {natural,crude,advanced,superior}
##Natural is stuff made in nature (duh). On average you can expect natural equipment to be worse, but there are exceptions
##such as... well... any dragon body part really. 
## Crude is basically anything made without artificial magic or metallurgy, including leather armor, slings, dragonbone armor, etc.
## Advanced is early middle ages metallurgy and smaller metal weapons, like chainmail, shortswords, etc.
## Superior is anything made with artificial magic, including enchanted equipment (as opposed to equipment made from magic materials, which could be crude),
## as well as large, heavy equipment, top quality steel, and middle to late midievable age weapons. This includes arming swords, rapiers, full plate, greatswords, crossbows, etc.

##Usage : An animal cannot drop anything that isn't natural, an Orc can't drop superior but can drop advanced, a death knight will only drop superior, etc.
