Most jiangshi were created in the early years of the Great War, when this phenomenon was still unknown, and many still wear their uniforms to this day. Congregating in necromantic societies, modern jiangshi train in stealth tactics rather than direct confrontation, in an effort to maintain their forever dwindling population."
