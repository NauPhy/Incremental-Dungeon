As a result, vampires are substantially more expensive to upkeep than skeletons and zombies, and as such are only raised by well established necromantic organisations, particuarly those with access to farm animals. They make up for their expensive lifestyle with their ferocity, cunning, and spellcasting, and wear the best equipment money can buy."
