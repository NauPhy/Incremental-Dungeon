introText = "It looks like the surface isn't the only place where volcanoes pierce the crust! In the distance you see a freshly active volcano, its growing pool of magma (lava?) setting trees ablaze from the nearby forest. You gaze at the pretty lights for a little while before you're startled by an explosion in the distance, most likely a fire elemental felled in combat against the forces of nature. You've walked into an active warzone."
